* BaseContainerTests<TService> or <TProfile,TSetup>
DONE
* TestFixture single scope only 
DONE sequential and parallel support
* Remove use of child scopes via Extension, use container only 
DONE
* Remove use of Services property 
DONE
* Get/Create mock thru Mock<T>() 
DONE retrieve thru method, create thru profile
* How can we auto indicate the mocks we need setup? 
DONE we just return a list in the profile
* Can use different testing profiles and disconnect from inheritance (pre-define elsewhere)
DONE - supports interface and dynamic composition
* AutoRest mocks per test?
DONE - by default we reset the mock afters a test
* Can we automatically detect Parallel testing and use multiple scopes
DONE - we now have parallel and sequential test fixtures
